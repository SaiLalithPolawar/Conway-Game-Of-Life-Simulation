# Conway-Game-Of-Life-Simulation

## Case Description

In this project, Developing Conway's Game of Life in Python iinvolves creating a simulation of the renowned Game of Life, conceived by mathematician John Horton Conway. It provides a great chance to utilize Python programming skills while delving into intriguing concepts in cellular automata, emergence, and complexity theory.

Conwayâ€™s Game of Life operates without player input and solely relies on an initial state. The game unfolds on an endless grid of square cells, each in either a live or dead state. Interactions occur among neighboring cells, with each cell having eight adjacent counterparts. The game progresses from its starting state based on predefined rules.

- A live cell remains alive if it has two or three live neighbors; otherwise, it dies due to either loneliness (with no or only one neighbor) or overpopulation (with four or more neighbors).

- A dead cell becomes alive if it has exactly three live neighbors; otherwise, it remains dead regardless of the number of neighbors.

In this project, the infinite grid is limited to predefined finite dimensions. Despite being simple, the Game of Life can generate complex behaviors with implications across various fields, spanning from physics and mathematics to philosophy and art


## Project Requirements

For the Conway's Game of Life project, Python 3 or a newer version and an IDE of your choice (such as Jupyter Notebook, Spyder, PyCharm, Visual Studio, etc.) will be used. However, please note that the attached file for this project is a Jupyter Notebook.
